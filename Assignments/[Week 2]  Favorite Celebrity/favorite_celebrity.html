            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p><strong>Adam Sandler </strong> is a renowned actor and comedian known for his distinctive
                brand of humor and memorable performances in film and television. Born on September 9,
                1966, in Brooklyn, New York, he is an American comedian,
                actor, screenwriter, and producer who gained widespread recognition through his time on
                "Saturday Night Live" and has since become a beloved figure in the entertainment industry.
                Primarily a comedic leading actor in
                film and television, his accolades include nominations for three Grammy Awards,
                five Primetime Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award.
                In 2023, Sandler was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.Sandler broke into film with small
                parts in such comedies as Shakes the Clown (1991); Coneheads (1993), which was based on an SNL sketch;
                and Mixed Nuts (1994). He established himself as a star with Billy Madison (1995), the first of a number
                of movies he cowrote; in it he played the oafish scion of a wealthy businessman who must prove his
                worthiness to succeed his father by repeating his schooling. Sandler’s humour, while derided by some
                critics as puerile, proved popular with moviegoers. A succession of films in which he played similarly
                inept and foulmouthed characters solidified his reputation as a reliable box-office draw.In 1999 Sandler
                formed his own production company, which produced his own films as well as vehicles for friends,
                including David Spade and Rob Schneider. While continuing to star in such comedies as Mr. Deeds (2002)
                and Anger Management (2003), Sandler made forays into drama with Punch-Drunk Love (2002) and Spanglish
                (2004). The latter performances won him critical accolades. He reunited with Barrymore in the romantic
                farce 50 First Dates (2004). In 2007 he appeared in Reign over Me, a dark comedy in which he evinced a
                man whose wife and children died in the September 11 attacks. The following year he returned to lighter
                fare with You Don’t Mess with the Zohan, about an Israeli military operative who moves to New York City
                to become a hairdresser.
